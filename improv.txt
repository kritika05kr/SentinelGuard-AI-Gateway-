🚀 NEXT STEPS
1️⃣ Add “Admin Dashboard”

Where you can:

view logs (what prompts were blocked, redacted, allowed)

see top violations (most common PII, secrets)

view policies & edit them

manage redaction templates

adjust thresholds

This will make it a product, not just a project.

2️⃣ Add "AI Explanation Tool"

Show WHY the guardrail blocked something:

“This matches company policy 4.3”

“Regex detector caught API key”

“ML model flagged 91% confidence risk”

More explainability = enterprise-ready.

3️⃣ Add “Policy Memory / RAG Search”

Upload:

employee handbook

security guidelines

compliance docs

Then:

SentinelGuard → automatically reads them → chunks → vectorizes → uses RAG → checks policies.

4️⃣ Turn it into a "Browser Extension"

So the guardrail sits on top of:

ChatGPT

Gemini

Copilot

Anything on the web

Super powerful.

5️⃣ Add logging + audit trail

So you can show:

timestamp

prompt

reason for block

risk score

sanitized version

This is required for SOC2 & ISO compliance type projects.

6️⃣ Deploy it online (free)

Without paying a single rupee:

Backend → Render free tier / Railway free tier

Frontend → Netlify / Vercel free

Vector DB → Local JSON or free FAISS

No paid APIs (we already avoided them)

7️⃣ Make a full README + Documentation

architecture diagram

flow diagrams

project description

screenshots

API documentation

installation steps

So you can put it on GitHub and showcase it as a portfolio project.
