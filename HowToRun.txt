🟦 1. Start the backend (FastAPI + Uvicorn)
Step 1: Open a new PowerShell window

Press Win key

Type PowerShell → Enter

Step 2: Go to backend folder
cd "C:\Projects\SentinelGuard AI Gateway\backend"


You can check you’re in the right place:

ls


You should see things like: app, policies, scripts, venv, requirements.txt etc.

Step 3: Activate virtual environment
.\venv\Scripts\Activate


You should now see:

(venv) PS C:\Projects\SentinelGuard AI Gateway\backend>


If you don’t see (venv), the venv is not active.

Step 4: Run the FastAPI server
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000


If everything is ok, you’ll see:

INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
[POLICY RAG] Loaded 33 chunks from ...chunked_policies.json


➡️ Do NOT close this window.
Just leave it running in the background.

Step 5: Quick backend test (optional but useful)

Open your browser and go to:

http://localhost:8000/docs


If you see Swagger UI with:

POST /api/analyze

POST /api/compliance/ask

→ backend is healthy ✅

🟩 2. Start the frontend (React + Vite)

Now open another PowerShell window (don’t close the backend one!).

Step 1: Go to frontend folder
cd "C:\Projects\SentinelGuard AI Gateway\frontend"


Check:

ls


You should see things like: src, index.html, package.json, vite.config, etc.

Step 2: Run the dev server
npm run dev


Vite will show something like:

VITE v5.x.x  ready in Xs

  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/


Again ➡️ Do NOT close this window.
Just keep it running.

Step 3: Open the UI

In your browser:

http://localhost:5173/


You should see your app with:

Top nav: SentinelGuard AI Gateway

Tabs: Guardrail Chat and Ask Compliance

🔁 Every time you restart your laptop / VS Code / anything

You always do:

For backend:

cd "C:\Projects\SentinelGuard AI Gateway\backend"
.\venv\Scripts\Activate
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000


For frontend:

cd "C:\Projects\SentinelGuard AI Gateway\frontend"
npm run dev


That’s it. No need to rebuild venv or reinstall npm packages unless you delete things.

❌ If something goes wrong

White blank page on http://localhost:5173
→ Check frontend terminal for red error.

Failed to fetch in UI
→ Backend probably crashed. Check the backend terminal for a red traceback.

http://localhost:8000/docs
 not opening
→ Backend is not running or crashed.

If you get a red error again, just copy the error text from PowerShell and paste it to me — I’ll tell you exactly what line to fix.
